# Welcome to the DefDev CI/CD training!

We are going to learn multiple ways to incorperate the security tooling into your CI/CD pipe-lines!
This repository contains demo files which we are going to use in our hands on parts of the training.
The purpose of these demo files is to 'demonstrate' (what's in a name right?) the aproaches we can take.

The most important thing we are going to take from this course is a agnostic aproach on integrating the 
security tooling into the CI/CD pipe-lines by containerizing the tooling and make it plug and play for every
CI environment!
